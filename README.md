# HAT 2.0

This repository contains an implementation of the [Hub-of-All-Things](http://hubofallthings.com) project Personal Data Store.

## Releases

The current project version is 2.2.0 [HAT 2.2.0](https://github.com/Hub-of-all-Things/HAT2.0/releases/tag/v2.2.0).

### News

HAT has undergone a major architectural rebuild for v2.2.0, the defining
change being the software stack's ability to now serve multiple HAT databases.
Assumed identity of a HAT is determined by the host address set in the incoming
connection, and the rest of the operations remain the same: each request is
authenticated using a JWT token signed by the specific HAT's private key
and every user authenticates with their database through the HAT stack.

HAT was also migrated from Akka Spray HTTP Framework to Play Framework due to
higher relative maturity.

Finally, contextual data APIs have not been ported over to the new version 
as it has been decided that they require a significant redesign to be 
sufficiently convenient for stronger adoption for developers. Therefore 
v2.2.0 only offers raw data APIs and contextless Data Debit data sharing
mechanisms.

## About the project

Hub-of-All-Things is a platform for a Multi-Sided Market powered by the Internet of Things.

A Personal Data Management System (“the HAT”) is a personal single tenant (“the individual self”) technology system that is fully individual self-service, to enable an individual to define a full set of “meta-data” defining as a specific set of personal data, personal preferences, personal behaviour events. The HAT allows individuals to share the right information (quality and quantity), with the right people, in the right situations for the right purposes and gain the benefits.

## Technology stack

This HAT PDS implementation is written in Scala (2.11.8) uses the following technology stack:

- PostgreSQL relational database (version 9.5)
- Play Framework (version 2.5.4)
- Akka (version 2.4.7)
- Slick as the database access layer (version 3.1.1)

## Running the project


### HAT Setup

HAT runs as a combination of a backing PostgreSQL database (with a 
[public schema](https://github.com/Hub-of-all-Things/hat-database-schema) 
for flattened data storage) and a software stack that provides logic to
work with the schema using HTTP APIs.

To run it from source in a development environment two sets of tools are required:

- PostgreSQL database and utilities
- Scala Build Tool (SBT)

To launch the HAT, follow these steps:

1. Create the database:
    ```
    createdb testhatdb1
    createuser testhatdb1
    psql postgres -c "GRANT CREATE ON DATABASE testhatdb1 TO testhatdb1"
    ```
2. Compile the project:
    ```
    sbt compile
    ```
3. Add custom local domain mapping to your `/etc/hosts` file. This will make sure when you go to the defined address from your machine you will be pointed back to your own machine. E.g.:
    ```
    127.0.0.1	bobtheplumber.hat.org
    ```
4. Run the project:
    ```
    sbt "project hat" -Dconfig.resource=dev.conf run
    ```
5. Go to http://bobtheplumber.hat.org:9000

**You're all set!**

### Customising development environment

Your best source of information on how the development environment could
be customised is the `hat/conf/dev.conf` configuration file. Make sure it
is *enabled* in `hat/conf/activeHats.conf` -- such setup is not intended
to be used in production, but becomes handy for local testing.

Specifically, it has 4 major sections:

- Enables the development environment self-initialisation module:
    ```
    play.modules {
      enabled += "org.hatdex.hat.modules.DevHatInitializationModule"
    }
    ```
- Sets the list of database evolutions to be executed on initialisation:
    ```
    devhatMigrations = [
      "evolutions/hat-database-schema/11_hat.sql",
      "evolutions/hat-database-schema/12_hatEvolutions.sql",
      "evolutions/hat-database-schema/13_liveEvolutions.sql"]
    ```  
- `devhats` list sets out the list of HATs that are served by the current server, for 
each including owner details to be initialised with and database access
credentials. Each specified database must exist before launching the server
but are initialised with the right schema at start time
- `hat` section lists all corresponding HAT configurations to serve, here
you could change the HAT domain name, owner's email address or public/private
keypair used by the HAT for its token operations
